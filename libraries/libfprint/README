libfprint is the centre of our efforts. libfprint is the component which does
the dirty work of talking to fingerprint reading devices, and processing
fingerprint data.

If you’re a user, you probably aren’t interested in libfprint, instead you
want to find some software which uses libfprint.

libfprint is of prime interest to developers wishing to add support for
specific fingerprinting hardware.
