QEMU is a generic and open source machine emulator and virtualizer,
statically linked.

After installation, you will need to run the following command to register the
binfmts you need (example here for arm):

  update-binfmts --import qemu-arm

If you uninstall this package, you can remove the binfmts have registered with:

  update-binfmts --package qemu-arm --remove qemu-arm /usr/bin
